# MLB Biomechanical Performance Analysis: Detroit Tigers üêØ‚öæ

## Project Overview

Welcome to the repository where we apply Performance Science Analysis to the world of baseball, specifically for the Detroit Tigers. This project involves a deep dive into the biomechanics of players, using data-driven methods to optimize pitching effectiveness and prevent injuries.

## üìä Focus Areas

### Biomechanical Analysis for Pitch Optimization
- **Metrics Analyzed**: Arm angles, torso bending, leg flexion, hip-shoulder separation.
- **Objective**: Enhance pitching mechanics, examining correlations with release speed, spin rate, and pitch type effectiveness.

### Predictive Modeling
- **Performance Models**: Predict pitching performance outcomes using machine learning, focusing on variables like pitch velocity and movement accuracy.
- **Injury Risk Models**: Create models to assess injury risks, using biomechanical stress indicators and historical injury data.

### Individualized Pitcher Profiles
- **Custom Profiles**: Develop unique biomechanical profiles for each pitcher, linking them to performance outcomes.
- **Training Tailoring**: Use these profiles for personalized training and technique adjustments.

### Injury Prevention Strategies
- **Monitoring**: Track biomechanical data for early signs of injury risks.
- **Collaboration**: Work with Sports Medicine for preventive strategies and adjustments.

### Technology and Continuous Learning
- **Tech Integration**: Stay updated with the latest in biomechanical analysis technology.
- **Model Refinement**: Regularly update models and approaches based on new data and findings.
